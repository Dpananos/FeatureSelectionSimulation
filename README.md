# Feature Selection Simulation

* `simulation.py` contains code to actually perform the simulations.

* `rcs.py` contains a sklearn transformer for restricted cubic splines.

* `make_data.py` contains helper functions to load in various data sets for the experiment.

* `make_plot.R` contains code to make figures (I used `ggplot2` because of `ggrepel`).
